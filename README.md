# function-sdk-rust

A Rust SDK for writing [Crossplane][crossplane] [composition functions][functions].

Modeled on [function-sdk-python] and [function-sdk-go]. A composition function
is a gRPC server implementing the `FunctionRunnerService` defined by
Crossplane's `apiextensions.fn.proto.v1` API; this SDK provides the generated
protocol types, a [function spec][spec] compliant server runtime, and helpers
for working with requests and responses.

## Layout

- `sdk/` - the `function-sdk-rust` crate.
  - `proto/v1/run_function.proto` - the vendored protocol definition.
  - `src/generated/` - checked-in code generated from the proto: prost types,
    the tonic gRPC server and client, protojson serde impls (pbjson), and the
    encoded file descriptor set used for gRPC server reflection.
  - `src/{server,request,response,resource,logging}.rs` - the hand-written
    SDK: runtime and helpers.
- `codegen/` - maintainer tool that regenerates `sdk/src/generated`.
- `example/` - an example function, the starting point for new functions.

## Writing a function

```rust
use function_sdk_rust::proto::v1::function_runner_service_server::FunctionRunnerService;
use function_sdk_rust::proto::v1::{RunFunctionRequest, RunFunctionResponse};
use function_sdk_rust::{resource, response};
use tonic::{Request, Response, Status};

struct Function;

#[tonic::async_trait]
impl FunctionRunnerService for Function {
    async fn run_function(
        &self,
        request: Request<RunFunctionRequest>,
    ) -> Result<Response<RunFunctionResponse>, Status> {
        let req = request.into_inner();

        // Copies the request's tag, desired state, and context forward.
        let mut rsp = response::to(&req, response::DEFAULT_TTL);

        let desired = rsp.desired.get_or_insert_default();
        let bucket = desired.resources.entry("bucket".to_string()).or_default();
        resource::update(bucket, &serde_json::json!({
            "apiVersion": "s3.aws.upbound.io/v1beta2",
            "kind": "Bucket",
            "spec": {"forProvider": {"region": "eu-central-1"}},
        })).map_err(|e| Status::internal(e.to_string()))?;

        Ok(Response::new(rsp))
    }
}
```

See `example/` for a complete function with a CLI entrypoint.

## Development

```shell
# Run tests.
cargo test

# Lint.
cargo clippy --workspace --tests

# Regenerate sdk/src/generated from the vendored proto (requires protoc).
cargo run -p codegen
```

The vendored proto's canonical source is
[crossplane/crossplane/proto/fn/v1][proto]. Only the v1 API is supported,
which requires Crossplane v1.17 or later.

## Differences from function-sdk-go

This SDK covers the same RunFunction protocol surface as [function-sdk-go],
with a few deliberate differences:

- **v1 only.** The v1beta1 compatibility service is not implemented.
  Functions built with this SDK require Crossplane v1.17 or later; all older
  versions are end of life.
- **No typed composite/composed resource wrappers.** function-sdk-go wraps
  resources in `composite.Unstructured`/`composed.Unstructured` with
  fieldpath accessors (`GetString("spec.region")`) and Crossplane machinery
  accessors, built on crossplane-runtime. The idiomatic Rust equivalent is
  serde: deserialize an observed or desired resource - composite or
  composed, they're both `Resource` - into your own struct with
  `resource::get`, or use `resource::struct_to_json` plus
  `serde_json::Value::pointer` for ad hoc paths. Build desired state from
  any `serde::Serialize` value via `resource::update`. Integral numbers
  survive the protobuf Struct round-trip, so integer fields deserialize
  cleanly.
- **Health is always on.** function-sdk-go's health service is opt-in
  (`WithHealthServer`); this SDK always serves the gRPC health API and
  reports the function as serving.
- **Graceful shutdown is built in.** The server drains in-flight requests on
  SIGTERM and SIGINT.
- **Metrics are Go-compatible, served as OpenMetrics first.** Like
  function-sdk-go, the server serves the gRPC server series on `:8080` at
  `/metrics` (`--metrics-address`, empty disables):
  `grpc_server_started_total`, `grpc_server_handled_total` (with
  `grpc_code`), `grpc_server_msg_received_total` and
  `grpc_server_msg_sent_total`, with the interceptor's exact names, labels
  and help strings - dashboards built for Go functions work unchanged. As
  in the Go SDK, only unary calls are counted (streaming reflection and
  health `Watch` exist as permanently zero series), every served method is
  pre-created at zero, and there is no handling-time histogram. The
  exposition differs deliberately: OpenMetrics 1.0 is the main format
  (readable beyond Prometheus), with the classic Prometheus text format
  served to an `Accept` header that asks for it. Built on
  [prometheus-client], the official OpenMetrics-native client - the only
  purpose-built alternative, [tonic-prometheus-layer], is pinned to tonic
  0.13 and would hold this SDK back. Since this SDK serves no v1beta1, the
  v1beta1 series the Go SDK pre-created do not exist here.
