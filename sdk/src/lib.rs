//! A Rust SDK for writing Crossplane composition functions.
//!
//! Composition functions are gRPC servers implementing the
//! [`FunctionRunnerService`] defined by Crossplane's
//! `apiextensions.fn.proto.v1` API. This SDK provides the generated protocol
//! types, a spec-compliant server runtime, and helpers for working with
//! requests and responses.
//!
//! The most important protocol rule: desired state is a fully specified
//! server-side apply intent, not a merge patch. Build responses with
//! [`response::to`] so the desired state and context accumulated by earlier
//! pipeline steps are copied forward; anything left out is deleted from the
//! cluster.
//!
//! [`FunctionRunnerService`]: proto::v1::function_runner_service_server::FunctionRunnerService
